JekyllCMS is a content editor for [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]. It's the missing
link for non-programmers to use Jekyll: a friendly backend.

If you want to improve JekyllCMS, see the [contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting started
In the spirit of GitHub Pages, you don't need to host anything yourself!

1. Get [a GitHub account][join]. Don't forget to [verify your email
   address][verify], otherwise GitHub won't update your website.

2. [Create][create] a repository for your website.

3. Go to [jekyllcms.grep.ro](http://jekyllcms.grep.ro) and authorize your GitHub account. You should
   then see a list of your repositories, including the new site. Click on it
   and start editing!
