[JekyllCMS](https://jekyllcms.grep.ro/) is a content editor for [GitHub
Pages][gh-pages]. Its purpose is to let non-programmers manage content in a
GitHub Pages website. It's not an end-to-end CMS, a technical person still
needs to set up the website and its layout, but it makes day-to-day content
editing painless.

If you want to improve JekyllCMS, see the [contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
